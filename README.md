I'm Li Qilin (Sicilia), a junior student in Chongqing University, majoring in Computer Science And Technology. In 2021, I'm visiting NUS, Singapore as a coursework exchange student.

ðŸ“š In this semester, I'm focusing on 3 main aspects: CTF, Machine Learning and some Info Retrivial projects.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an EYEGAZE project, hopefully to build a system that can capture and estimate human eye's gaze direction.
